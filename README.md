# Password Generator

## Description

This project is a password generator, to be used to generate passwords between the length of 8 and 128 characters, utilizing upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters as per the user's choice. As this uses Math.random, which is not cryptographically secure (click [here](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_random.asp) for reference), this is meant as an experiment in utilizing JavaScript for user interactivity and was one of my first practical applications of JavaScript.
